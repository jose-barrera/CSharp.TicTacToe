# Tic Tac Toe

A desktop application to play this classic game.

**Object oriented paradigm** is used to define and implement the following classes:

* Piece
* PieceX
* PieceO
* Board
* Position
* Player
* PlayerList
* Game

All this classes implement the representation and behaviour of the game, regardless of GUI. Delegates and event-handlers are also used to comunicate the game events to the GUI.

GUI controls are enabled/disabled based on game state to allow the players only context-valid actions.
